# Introduction

The goal of this session is to collaboratively solve a series of challenges that will introduce you to practices that enable you scale up your computations.

The data

- (Re)introduce the Penguins data

A common challenge: Repeating things

- split, apply, combine

Several tools that can help us apply this workflow

- tidyverse: tables, group_by, summarise/mutate
- map: for lists / vectors
- ggplot: facets 
- functions


## Load libraries

We will primarily be using packages from the {tidyverse}, feel free to add more packages here to help solve the challenges.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
dir.create("output")
```


## Challenge 0 - Loading data from many files

We have just returned from an expedition from Anatarcia and collected *a lot* of data from multiple species of penguins. Sometimes "we" counted the penguins.  Sometimes we didn't.  We recorded data for each species in separate `.csv` files but **we need to combine these into one large dataframe for analyses. How can we do this programmatically?**

```{r, learner-solutions}
list.files("data/penguin_distributions", pattern = ".csv",full.names = TRUE) |>
  map(read_csv, show_col_type=F) |>
  list_rbind() -> a


```

## Challenge 1 - Import common names

We only have latin names for each species of penguin but we need common names for when we report our results to stakeholders. Our collaborator started compiling common names in a separate `.csv` in the `data/` folder. **Compile the common names for the remaining taxa and join these into the dataframe `penguins_combined`. You may need to import the `penguins_combined.csv` into R first.

## Challenge 2 - Add n_records as a column

For your analysis, you need to calculate the total number of records available for each species, and add that as a new column in your data.

}


a |>
  group_by(species) |>
  summarise(number_records=n(), max_count=max(individualCount,na.rm=T)) -> sp_summary

a |>
  group_by(species) |>
  mutate(number_records=n()) -> add_col_to_a


```

## Challenge 3 - Determine the top 3 most recorded taxa

We need to know which are the top 3 species that we have the the most records. Can you figure which species are these?

## Challenge 4 - Excluding rogue data

We need to clean the data a little before we analyse it. Clean the data so that we have

- Individual counts < 0
- Observations from iNaturalist and eBird using the `institutionCode` (the code for eBird is confusingly "CLO"; the code for iNaturalist is more sensibly "iNaturalist")

Export this dataset as a `.csv`

write.csv(a_individualCount_noneZero, "data/")
```

## Challenge 5 - Add Size information

We need to get compute the average bill and flipper dimensions using the `penguin_sizes` data and nd merge this into the `penguins_combined` dataset. You name need to wrangle/create the penguin names a little

## Challenge 6 - Export data by year

Your collaborator at the museum requires the giant penguin dataset to be broken down and saved as `.csv` by year. Solve this challenge with code!!

## Challenge 7 - How much do different penguin species migrate

Your penguin collaborator knows from natural history knowledge that some penguins migrate and others don't but no one has ever quantified this.  Calculate the difference between the summer median latitude and the winter median latitude for each species.  (Median is more robust to outliers so that's more appropriate here compared to the mean.) Note there may be species with missing data for certain seasons and this may lead to missing species in the final plot. 

Make a plot of species by degrees latitude migrated.

## Challenge 8 - Lots of descriptive statistics

We need to report on some descriptive statistics of our penguin study. We need to know the following:

- How many different genera are represented in our dataset
- How many different species do we have for each genera
- Calculate the proportion of points from iNaturalist and eBird using the institutionCode (the code for eBird is confusingly "CLO"; the code for iNaturalist is more sensibly "iNaturalist")
- How many records by species
- How many records by year
- How many records by country code
- How many records by basis of record

## Challenge 9 - Facet plot and export plots

We want some good visualisations of our data.

a. Make a multipanel plot of global distribution of penguins, with a panel for each genus
b. Make a multipanel plot of by month
c. Make a multipanel plot of by genus on the y-axis and individual count (<10 or >=10) on the x-axis

## Challenge 11 - Make a lot of maps

## Challenge 12 - Fit lots of models

In your analyses, sometimes you need to fit one complex model, other times you might be fitting many seperate models. How do we do that efficiently?

You been asked to fit a linear model between log_count and latitude, for each speces. Fit the models and extract the r2 for each model fit.
